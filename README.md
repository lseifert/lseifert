- 👋 Hi, I’m @lseifert
- 👀 I’m interested in not sharing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that if you don't post crap under your own name you don't get opensource karma. So those anonymous bug reports providing epic detail, don't count and you are basically a worthless piece of shit that should be fucked with mercilessly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothign because collaboration has ended up putting me in my parents basement. 
- 📫 I generally don't like being reached.
