- 👋 Hi, I’m @lseifert
- 👀 I’m interested in not sharing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that if you don't post crap under your own name you don't get opensource karma. So those anonymous bug reports providing epic detail, don't count and you are basically a worthless piece of shit that should be fucked with mercilessly. I am also learning what a shitty language python is for anything that shouldn't change major functionality five times a week. Imagine how fun walking would be if the ground just randomy changed by 4 feet every half a second and didn't stop for five fucking years. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing because collaboration has ended up putting me in my parents basement. 
- 📫 I generally don't like being reached.
